we use a pre-trained model trained on Face recognition to recognize similar faces.Here, we are particularlyinterested in recognizing whether two given faces are of the same person or not.


I applied the pre-trained VGG face model and weights and loaded all the images embeddings.Then performed PCA for dimesionality reduction from 2622 to 128.
‚óè Build an SVM classifier to map each image to its right person and predict their faces using SVM model.I am able to achieve 96 % accuracy.
